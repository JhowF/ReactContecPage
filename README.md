I created this project with four friends, did all the design and defined the role for each member of our group, we used React router-dom to handle the routes and fetch api to handle the consumption of the news api, we also used a lightweight git flow , working with different branches and a pull request system where the code was evaluated by all members before being merged to the main branch, a relevant detail is that all the css of the project was made to hard code without use from any external library
